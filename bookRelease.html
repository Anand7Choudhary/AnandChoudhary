                        One snippet from the Book<br><br>
                        Every moment spent with you, is a whispered thank you to the heavens,<br>
                        A prayer that rose from depths unknown, a gift that life had given.<br>
                        In the warmth of morning’s first embrace, in nightfall’s tender gleam,<br>
                        You were the spark within my soul, my heart’s enduring dream.<br><br>

                        Through fleeting days and endless nights, we danced on borrowed time,<br>
                        Two souls entwined in fleeting grace, a silent, sacred rhyme.<br>
                        And though the world may drift us far, your essence lingers near,<br>
                        In every breath, in every thought, your love remains sincere.<br><br>

                        You are the memory etched in light, the echo I can't release,<br>
                        The soft, unspoken melody that gives my heart its peace.<br>
                        I loved you in the quiet hours, I loved you in the ache,<br>
                        And even as you slipped away, I loved for love’s own sake.<br><br>

                        If love is loss, then so be it, if love is pain, I’ll bear it true,<br>
                        For every whispered thank you holds the heaven that was you.<br>
                        And though you’re gone beyond my grasp, the ache remains so blue,<br>
                        I'm endlessly, hopelessly, jealous of the air around you.

            <p class="title">91 Days</p>
            <p class="text">
                A collection of stories and poems for 13weeks divided into 13 chapters and each chapter accounting for 5-7 emotions. Representing
                each day of that time.<br><br>
                
                In these 91 days, I poured out every part of myself raw, vulnerable, unfiltered. These pages
                hold the moments we shared, the warmth of mornings when nothing else mattered, the quiet glances that
                spoke what words never could. Each line here is a heartbeat, a memory etched in ink, meant to keep alive
                what we created together.<br><br>

                There were days of laughter, days of complete stillness, where even silence felt sacred. There were also
                days of struggle, of love wrapped in quiet resilience, holding on when it would have been easier to let
                go. In those weeks, I found beauty in the smallest things, a hand held tightly, a kiss that felt like a
                promise, a tear wiped away in understanding.<br><br>

                This book is a testament to those moments. To the love that tried, that gave its all, that saw beauty
                even in brokenness. If you ever read these words, I hope you feel the love that was real, the devotion
                that was unwavering. I hope you remember that for those 91 days, there was nothing I wouldn’t have done,
                no dream I wouldn’t have chased, no part of myself I wouldn’t have shared. And though those days are
                gone, the depth of that love remains, here in these words forever untouched, forever yours.</p>
