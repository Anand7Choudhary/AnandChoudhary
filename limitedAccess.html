                Happy Ganesh Chaturti aunty, wishing you and your family a beautify year. It is Anand this side. Had a
                very short meet with you and uncle but trust me, heard a lot of fun stuffs from Vallabhi. The same
                Vallabhi that today forces me to harm myself, to trust no bond, attempt suicide. The same Vallabhi,
                because of which I cried constantly for 3 months, started to take counselling , walked to temple crying
                and begging for peace, the same Vallabhi.
                <br><br>
                Nothing sudden here. You possibly have heard that I take care of her, was with her when every single one
                of them went on a trip, and remember you talking about the good karma that she did because she got me
                around. But that Vallabhi today accuses me that I did it for wrong intentions, I never cared for her, I
                can never care for her when weak.
                <br><br>
                A very sudden message, let me tell you. March 9th me and Vallabhi felt there might be something we can
                work on as a partner. We were mature to first focus on our careers, our growth, connections and then us
                followed by introducing us to our parents. But I developed some issues with her. Being very blunt
                because this has caused me lot of problem. During our relation, she became close to other men,
                specifically Mukunthan. She being my partner, cheated me with him as she slept with him, she did all her
                basic with him, gets involved with him. That's the first time when me and everyone told her that these
                principals are not right. As a partner this did hurt.
                <br><br>
                Our relationship lasted for 13 weeks, march 9th to May 26th. We broke up twice as she wanted me to still
                be with her but she kept getting involved with him. As a human it felt disgusting seeing your partner
                with these behaviour. When I told her that he is getting way to close mentally and physically she denies
                them. To sleep with another man even casually when you are in relation when I am not present was wrong
                and mentally haunting. This was the principal she wanted to follow. Well this was told to her by me, by
                all the people around to both Vallabhi and Mukunthan. He having her personal clothes, night movies were
                not what you would expect from a potential half.
                <br><br>
                Post break up, I missed her and for the first time asked her constanly for a try, she wanted to focus on
                her career and she denied. But during this process, 1 week post sepration she makes out with Mukunthan
                and states this because she was in a vulnerable state? He being drunk uses the opportunity? Well she
                tells this was less than 1s interaction, but was caught by people around. If you would put your leg in
                my shoes, you would know the pain. My partner then was always involved with him during us, 1-2 weeks
                post distancing she makes out? The level of disrespect, betrayal, and cheated I felt from her and from
                my 5 year old friend was painful.
                <br><br>
                Everyone distanced from them, and then I asked her to try us again because I cared for her. I have
                prayed for her and seeing her in this state was not right. She ask for time and then breaks her leg.
                Post that she made some claims that she later was sorry about, but that was it. Hence, You never saw me
                in 9th floor anytime during your visit, because I was hurt, crying everyday of this cheat, allegations
                like me forcing her to dance, sleep, kiss, wrong intentions that made me weak and I did not want to be
                associated with her or Mukunthan. When her leg got fine, she comes on top to fold her hands to say
                sorry. My mistake was that I again believed her and we became friends.
                <br><br>
                No one wanted to stick around, call them for games, used me as bait to be away from them and pretty sure
                you also did realize this one night.
                <br><br>
                Post your trip start, she did not behave the same, she started calling me double face because of all the
                lies people told and she never believed me. I even came to her asking if she really wanted to be my
                friend, because she did not behave like one or probably I did not behave is what she tells, I left her
                when she told the false claims, would leave the friendship if she felt any bad touch. But calling me
                double face was wrong, getting manipulated by others and Mukunthan and hurting me was wrong. They kept
                breaking me during relation, post that and now.
                <br><br>
                I have begged them for life for all these allegations. One day she tells she is sorry for what she told
                and the next day she make new statements. 2 days back, she tells me that she is eventually dating
                Mukunthan and in a live in with him. I had only these question.
                <ol>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        I was always telling the truth, when I felt his wrong intentions and Vallabhi's behaviour. I
                        pointed this point and she tell me "She refused to believe me when partner", but still stayed
                        with me as
                        option?
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        When she did not trust or believe me or anyone else. Why did she still stay
                        with me for around 1.5months more. Was it for fun? I was not for fun or jokes. She kept my life
                        as option.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Now that she's building a future with Mukunthan, she tells me that she's sorry for not believing
                        and past cannot be changed. She knew from the very start that I was telling the truth, then why
                        3 months of harassment? Absolute harassment? Her actions, my reaction? both delt with it
                        because she just wanted to play with my life?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I come from a very simple family, with lot of finical hurdle, lot of relation losses. I was disciplined,
                I prayed, exercised, worked from 10 to 8pm everyday, 3 meals a day, I did not deserved for someone to
                come into my life and not trust me and leave like nothing happened. No sleep for days, panic attacks,
                cries, hunger, insecurities.
                <br><br>
                Here's something about me. I have lost my sister through suicide. I have got her down with my own hands.
                Relationships are important to me, prayers are important to me, building a career for me, my family, for
                Vallabhi was important to me. My life was already in pain with all the financial strains and
                responsibility. Your daughter doing this was not right. She comes to tell me sorry and say we cannot
                change the past because of her mistakes does not give me my time and energy back. She has moved on with
                him, with whome she cheated on with. The hurt remained hurt.
                <br><br>
                I cared for her even when I had no energy for myself, you knew that. I loved her even if I did not love
                my self. I cried for her for 3 months doing nothing because of all this. I prayed for her, I begged
                them. And she tells past cannot be changed and she's sorry. She tells me I'm weak, yes I am weak when I
                see a relation die, yes I'm weak when I get backstabbed by my friends, yes I am weak when she tells she
                did not trust me yet was with me, as an option? yes I am weak when my partner cheats.
                <br><br>
                Why this to you? because it has been tough, really tough. Have called my other sister from India to take
                care of me so that I don't die. I expected a lot from them and that's my fault. There were multiple tags
                thrown at each other, about each principals, upbringing, intentions, behaviour, I forcing her to dance,
                sleep with me? Not sure how I can force someone strong minded like Vallabhi to physically be around me.
                the only thing I did not do is cheat on a human, lied to a human, betrayed a human, never left the weak
                crying.
                <br><br>
                She and him think they are building a future, but after doing this to me? they believe playing with my
                life is a good base to build their relation? It is very sudden I know, but ask anyone around, they'll
                let you know how I have been treated. I have lost my self respect defending them and they kept lying
                about me. You can contact anyone, Aastha, Archit, Aschariya, Shruti, Amit.
                <br><br>
                To you, I did take care of her much before this, because she was my friend. During relation, I took care
                of her more than myself. Now she tells you that I left her, people left her or is it just the opposite.
                <br><br>
                I guess it's high time I took care of myself and stand for myself. She's in a livein with Mukunthan,
                building a future on my life's pain. For me he's is shameless to do this to his friend and Vallabhi,
                that she's no more in my life. They kept telling I'm overthinking. It's not overthinking if I was right.
                I'll take a stand for myself. Towards you aunty, I cared for her and people have seen the efforts is all
                I want to tell.
                <br><br>
                I was weak to not leave her after her initial behaviour and cheating of staying with me without trust. I
                was weak, have cried to my mom. Am weak that Vallabhi tells she wants to be with the strong and not help
                the weak. What they owe me is the capability to love someone again, trust someone, and make new friends.
                I have lost all these.
